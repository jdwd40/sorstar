# **Sorstar MVP**

**Sorstar** is an economic and political simulator set in a small galaxy of 10 unique planets. The app allows players to explore planets, manage resources, establish trade routes, and influence planetary politics to build their empire. 

This is the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** version of the app, focusing on core features such as:
- Viewing a galaxy map with a list of planets.
- Exploring planet details like resources, population, and military data.
- A simple and intuitive player interface.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

### **Current Status**
This project is a **work in progress**. The MVP is being built in stages, starting with:
1. Scaffolding and database connection.
2. A basic galaxy map view displaying a list of planets.
3. Planet stats and detailed information.

Future updates will introduce interactive trade routes, resource management, and combat mechanics.

### **Stay Tuned**
The app will eventually go live, allowing you to experience the full galaxy simulation firsthand. For now, this repository serves as the development hub for *Sorstar*. ðŸš€
